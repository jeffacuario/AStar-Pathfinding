# A* Pathfinding

Utilizing pygame to create a 2-Dimension visualization of the A star path finding algorithm.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm

How to use:
Left click - add node(s) to the grid
Right click - delete node(s) from the grid
Spacebar - start algorithm

Click to add "starting" node then add "end" node. Add any barriers and then press the spacebar to begin the algorithm.  If a valid path is found, the shortest path will be reconstructed in purple.

Have fun!
